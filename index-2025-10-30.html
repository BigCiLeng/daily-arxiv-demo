Prevailing methods often rely on the one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is resource-intensive and fundamentally incapable of generalizing to unseen effects, thus limiting scalability and creation. To address this challenge, we introduce VFXMaster, the first unified, reference-based framework for VFX video generation. It recasts effect generation as an in-context learning task, enabling it to reproduce diverse dynamic effects from a reference video onto target content. In addition, it demonstrates remarkable generalization to unseen effect categories. Specifically, we design an in-context conditioning strategy that prompts the model with a reference example. An in-context attention mask is designed to precisely decouple and inject the essential effect attributes, allowing a single unified model to master the effect imitation without information leakage. In addition, we propose an efficient one-shot effect adaptation mechanism to boost generalization capability on tough unseen effects from a single user-provided video rapidly.

However, extending these methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models poses significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a training-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of training a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a pre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape prior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by treating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images captured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the object's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring task-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets.

In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image, while the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of regions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational redundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead applying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates us to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that accelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE framework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We observed that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for multi-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in the early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited regions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the reference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions, we replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas. For edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative denoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation, we propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost while incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache. Observing that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity similarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate the local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base models, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE achieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06.

In addition, active learning, which aims to proactively select the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation, has been explored in semi-supervised 3D Action Recognition for training sample selection. Specifically, researchers adopt an encoder-decoder framework to embed skeleton sequences into a latent space, where clustering information, combined with a margin-based selection strategy using a multi-head mechanism, is utilized to identify the most informative sequences in the unlabeled set for annotation.

However, most previous methods usually solve these two tasks separately, and their prediction of gaze objects and gaze following typically depend on head-related prior knowledge during both the training phase and real-world deployment. This dependency necessitates an auxiliary network to extract head location, thus precluding joint optimization across the entire system and constraining the practical applicability. To this end, we propose GaTector+, a unified framework for gaze object detection and gaze following, which eliminates the dependence on the head-related priors during inference. Specifically, GaTector+ uses an expanded specific-general-specific feature extractor that leverages a shared backbone, which extracts general features for gaze following and object detection using the shared backbone while using specific blocks before and after the shared backbone to better consider the specificity of each sub-task. To obtain head-related knowledge without prior information, we first embed a head detection branch to predict the head of each person. Then, before regressing the gaze point, a head-based attention mechanism is proposed to fuse the sense feature and gaze feature with the help of head location.

Existing SFDA methods are restricted by the fundamental limitation of source-target domain discrepancy. Non-generation SFDA methods suffer from unreliable pseudo-labels in challenging scenarios with large domain discrepancies, while generation-based SFDA methods are evidently degraded due to enlarged domain discrepancies in creating pseudo-source data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel generation-based framework named Diffusion-Driven Progressive Target Manipulation (DPTM) that leverages unlabeled target data as references to reliably generate and progressively refine a pseudo-target domain for SFDA. Specifically, we divide the target samples into a trust set and a non-trust set based on the reliability of pseudo-labels to sufficiently and reliably exploit their information. For samples from the non-trust set, we develop a manipulation strategy to semantically transform them into the newly assigned categories, while simultaneously maintaining them in the target distribution via a latent diffusion model. Furthermore, we design a progressive refinement mechanism that progressively reduces the domain discrepancy between the pseudo-target domain and the real target domain via iterative refinement. Experimental results demonstrate that DPTM outperforms existing methods by a large margin and achieves state-of-the-art performance on four prevailing SFDA benchmark datasets with different scales.

Unlike diffusion-based generative models, which require costly numerical integration of a generative ODE to sample images with state-of-the-art quality, rectified flow uses an iterative process called reflow to learn smooth and straight ODE paths. This allows for relatively simple and efficient generation of high-quality images. However, rectified flow still faces several challenges. 1) The reflow process requires a large number of generative pairs to preserve the target distribution, leading to significant computational costs. 2) Since the model is typically trained using only generated image pairs, its performance heavily depends on the 1-rectified flow model, causing it to become biased towards the generated data. In this work, we experimentally expose the limitations of the original rectified flow and propose a novel approach that incorporates real images into the training process. By preserving the ODE paths for real images, our method effectively reduces reliance on large amounts of generated data. Instead, we demonstrate that the reflow process can be conducted efficiently using a much smaller set of generated and real images. In CIFAR-10, we achieved significantly better FID scores, not only in one-step generation but also in full-step simulations, while using only of the generative pairs compared to the original method.

When more information about the surrounding environment becomes available, a static shape often no longer minimizes the original protection cost. We propose a formation planner to reduce mismatch between a formation and the cost function while still leveraging efficient formation controllers. Our formation planner is a two-step optimization problem that identifies desired relative robot positions. We first solve a constrained problem to estimate non-linear and non-differentiable costs with a weighted sum of surrogate cost functions. We theoretically analyze this problem and identify situations where weights do not need to be updated. The weighted, surrogate cost function is then minimized using relative positions between robots. The desired relative positions are realized using a non-cooperative formation controller derived from Lyapunov's direct approach. We then demonstrate the efficacy of this approach for military-like costs such as protection and obstacle avoidance. In simulations, we show a formation planner can reduce a single cost by over 75%. When minimizing a variety of cost functions simultaneously, using a formation planner with adaptive weights can reduce the cost by 20-40%.

To address these gaps, we propose a hybrid visual tracking framework that bridges advanced perception with real-time servo control. First, a fast global template matcher constrains the pose search region; next, a deep-feature Lucas-Kanade module operating on early VGG layers refines alignment to sub-pixel accuracy (<2px); then, a lightweight residual regressor corrects local misalignments caused by texture degradation or partial occlusion. When visual confidence falls below a threshold, a GRU-based predictor seamlessly extrapolates pose updates from recent motion history. Crucially, the pipeline's final outputs-translation, rotation, and scale deltas-are packaged as direct control signals for 30Hz image-based servo loops. Evaluated on handheld video sequences with up to 90% occlusion, our system sustains under 2px tracking error, demonstrating the robustness and low-latency precision essential for reliable real-world robot vision applications.", "primary_subject": "Robotics (cs.RO)", "subjects": ["Robotics (cs.RO)"], "section_type": "Authors and titles", "submission_date": "2025-10-30", "keywords": ["visual", "tracking"]}, {"arxiv_id": "arXiv:2510.25211", "title": "RoadSens-4M: A Multimodal Smartphone & Camera Dataset for Holistic Road-way Analysis", "abs_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25211", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25211", "authors": ["Amith Khandakar", "David Michelson", "Shaikh Golam Rabbani", "Fariya Bintay Shafi", "Md.

Experiments on nuScenes dataset show our image-only method simultaneously generates high-quality depth, scene flow, and 3D Gaussian point clouds online, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis.", "primary_subject": "Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)", "subjects": ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)", "Machine Learning (cs.LG)", "Robotics (cs.RO)"], "section_type": "Authors and titles", "submission_date": "2025-10-30", "keywords": ["DrivingScene", "scene_flow"]}], "stats": {"total": 37, "total_authorships": 174, "unique_authors": 169, "section_counts": {"Authors and titles": 37}, "top_authors": [["Hubert Gattringer", 3], ["Andreas Mueller", 3], ["Bernhard Rameder", 2], ["Kush Hari", 1], ["Ziyang Chen", 1]], "top_phrases": [["Vision-Language-Action", 2], ["calibration", 2], ["STITCH", 1], ["sutures", 1], ["tool", 1]], "average_authors": 4.702702702702703}}}, "preferences": {"favorite_authors": ["barron", "Fei-Fei Li"], "keywords": ["reconstruction", "gaussian splatting"]}, "default_source": "cs.CV"}</script>
